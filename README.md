# Abstract
Many people who lack an extensive credit history find it exceedingly difficult to receive a loan. As a result, these people get taken advantage of by shady lenders. The purpose of this project is to use alternative data about customers to determine whether or not they have the ability to repay their loans. This is a supervised binary classification problem. 

The dataset is provided by Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/overview) in the context of a competition. The training data contains 300K+ records of historical customer data labeled 1 or 0 for having repaid the loan or not. There are 122 columns and lots of missing values so there is a lot of work to be done for feature engineering. The point of the project is to use this historical data to accurately predict if customers can repay loans without requiring their credit history.

For example, the first column is 'NAME_CONTRACT_TYPE' which can be either 'Cash loan' or 'Revolving loans'.
